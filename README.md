OpenAI Integration with AWS Lambda

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and necessary files for integrating OpenAI's GPT models with AWS Lambda through the use of Lambda Layers. This enables the deployment of powerful AI functionalities within AWS cloud applications efficiently.
Getting Started

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of AWS services, including AWS Lambda and IAM, as well as familiarity with Python programming.
Prerequisites

    An AWS account
    AWS CLI installed and configured
    Basic Python knowledge

Installation & Setup
Step 1: Add the Lambda Layer

    Download the Lambda Layer ZIP file: Clone this repository to access the Lambda Layer ZIP file prepared for the OpenAI integration.
    pload the ZIP file to your AWS account: Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to upload the provided openai-lambda-layer.zip file to your Lambda function as a new layer.

Step 2: Add the Layer to Your Lambda Function

You can add the OpenAI Lambda Layer to your AWS Lambda function using either the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

    Using the AWS Console:
        Navigate to your Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
        Go to the "Layers" section in your function's configuration page.
        Click "Add a layer", select "Custom layers", and choose the OpenAI layer you've uploaded.

Step 3: Update Your Lambda Function Code

Replace your existing Lambda function code with the code provided in this repository (lambda_function.py). This script is designed to interact with OpenAI's API using the credentials and setup defined in the layer.
Ensure you replace 'your-openai-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key.
Usage

Invoke your Lambda function with an event payload that includes a prompt to receive a response generated by OpenAI's GPT model.
